# BodyLife CRM implementation progress

Дата старту: 2026-07-08

## Milestone 1 plan

1. Solution/project scaffold.
2. Module folder structure.
3. EF Core/Npgsql/PostgreSQL setup.
4. Baseline migration and reviewable SQL workflow.
5. Health checks and structured logging foundation.
6. Analyzer/build gates and CI.
7. Test projects and PostgreSQL integration/migration harness.
8. Playwright smoke harness for tablet/phone reception entry.
9. Documentation/progress cleanup.

## Step 1 - Solution/project scaffold

Status: completed.

Scope:

- Create the solution file for the BodyLife CRM modular monolith.
- Add the hosted Razor Pages web project for the internal reception-first app.
- Add a core project placeholder for later business modules.
- Route `/` to the reception page so the first screen is not a generic CRUD or landing page.
- Keep EF Core, migrations, health checks, structured logging, analyzers, test projects and Playwright for later small steps.

Validation:

- `/tmp/bodylife-dotnet/dotnet build BodyLife.Crm.sln --nologo` passed with 0 warnings and 0 errors.
- The SDK was installed locally for this session at `/tmp/bodylife-dotnet` because `dotnet` was not available in PATH.
- `graphify update .` completed for code changes.
- `graphify . --update` was attempted for the new markdown progress file but the CLI stopped because no semantic extraction API key/backend is configured.

Commit:

- `30009e9 build(infra): scaffold ASP.NET Core foundation`.

Next recommended step:

- Add the module folder structure and allowed shared primitives layout.

## Step 2 - Module folder structure

Status: completed.

Scope:

- Add core project folders for accepted top-level modules: Clients/Search, MembershipTypes, Memberships, Visits, Payments, Freezes, NonWorkingDays, Reports, Audit and Users/Roles.
- Add narrow shared primitives for IDs, Money, DateRange, actor/session context and request correlation id.
- Add command/query application conventions for common command envelopes, results and error taxonomy.
- Do not add persistence, EF Core, migrations, health checks, logging pipeline, test projects or business workflow implementations in this step.

Validation:

- `/tmp/bodylife-dotnet/dotnet build BodyLife.Crm.sln --nologo` passed with 0 warnings and 0 errors.
- `/tmp/bodylife-dotnet/dotnet format BodyLife.Crm.sln --verify-no-changes --verbosity minimal` passed.
- Module marker files exist for all accepted top-level module boundaries.
- `graphify update .` and `graphify update . --no-cluster` were attempted for code graph maintenance, but both stopped with `[Errno 95] Operation not supported`.
- `graphify . --update` was attempted for the progress markdown update, but the CLI stopped because no semantic extraction API key/backend is configured.

Commit:

- `3288dab build(shared): add module boundary conventions`.

Next recommended step:

- Add EF Core/Npgsql/PostgreSQL setup.

## Step 3 - EF Core/Npgsql/PostgreSQL setup

Status: completed.

Scope:

- Add a separate infrastructure project for EF Core/Npgsql persistence wiring.
- Add `BodyLifeDbContext` with PostgreSQL default schema and migrations history table settings.
- Register persistence in the hosted web app through configuration.
- Add a local development connection string placeholder for PostgreSQL.
- Keep baseline migrations, schema tables, PostgreSQL containers, health checks and integration tests for later small steps.

Validation:

- `/tmp/bodylife-dotnet/dotnet restore BodyLife.Crm.sln --nologo` passed.
- `/tmp/bodylife-dotnet/dotnet build BodyLife.Crm.sln --nologo` passed with 0 warnings and 0 errors.
- `/tmp/bodylife-dotnet/dotnet format BodyLife.Crm.sln --verify-no-changes --verbosity minimal` passed.
- `dotnet-ef dbcontext info` passed using temporary tool install at `/tmp/bodylife-dotnet-tools`; provider is Npgsql, database is `bodylife_crm_dev`, and migrations history table is `bodylife.__ef_migrations_history`.
- Web smoke returned `HTTP/1.1 200 OK` for `/`; local ASP.NET DataProtection logged warnings because this WSL profile has existing Windows-DPAPI-protected keys.
- `graphify update .` was attempted for code graph maintenance but stopped with `[Errno 95] Operation not supported`.
- `graphify . --update` was attempted for the progress markdown update but stopped because no semantic extraction API key/backend is configured.

Commit:

- `build(infra): wire EF Core PostgreSQL persistence`.

Next recommended step:

- Add the baseline migration and reviewable SQL workflow.

## Step 4 - Baseline migration and reviewable SQL workflow

Status: completed.

Scope:

- Add the initial EF Core baseline migration for the PostgreSQL `bodylife` schema.
- Keep the baseline free of business shortcut tables.
- Add a local `dotnet-ef` tool manifest.
- Add a script to generate idempotent migration SQL for review/deploy preparation.
- Keep real source-fact tables, constraints, indexes, seed/bootstrap data, integration tests and health checks for later small steps.

Validation:

- `/tmp/bodylife-dotnet/dotnet build BodyLife.Crm.sln --nologo` passed with 0 warnings and 0 errors.
- `/tmp/bodylife-dotnet/dotnet format BodyLife.Crm.sln --verify-no-changes --verbosity minimal` passed.
- `dotnet tool restore --tool-manifest .config/dotnet-tools.json` restored `dotnet-ef` 10.0.4.
- `dotnet-ef migrations list --no-connect` listed `20260708140900_InitialBaseline`.
- `DOTNET_BIN=/tmp/bodylife-dotnet/dotnet ./scripts/generate-migration-sql.sh /tmp/bodylife-baseline.sql` generated idempotent SQL that creates only the `bodylife` schema and EF migrations history table.
- PostgreSQL migration apply check could not run in this WSL distro because Docker, `psql` and `pg_isready` are not available. SQLite/EF InMemory was not used as a substitute.
- `graphify update .` completed for code graph maintenance.
- `graphify . --update` was attempted for the progress markdown update but stopped because no semantic extraction API key/backend is configured.

Commit:

- `build(infra): add baseline migration workflow`.

Next recommended step:

- Add health checks and structured logging foundation.
